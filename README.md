[] - integrate google calendar events

[] - first commit and then submit tempo time sheets on command
[] - get previous day logs, sync with jira to have the task description
[] - everyday before standup, generate report from previous day (days if without description) and add description to events
[] - move windows to horizontal workspaces when reducing the number of monitors
